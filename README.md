# Product Analytics Case Study — SQL & Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world **Product Analytics** scenario where a data analyst is responsible for analyzing user behavior, conversion funnels, retention, and revenue metrics for a digital product (SaaS / app).

The goal is to demonstrate strong **SQL skills**, solid **data modeling**, and the ability to translate data into **business insights** that support product and growth decisions.

---

## 🎯 Business Questions
The analysis focuses on answering key questions such as:

- Where are users dropping off in the product funnel?
- How does user retention behave over time?
- Which user cohorts generate the most value?
- What metrics should product managers monitor daily?
- Where are the biggest opportunities to improve conversion or revenue?

## 📊 Key Metrics Analyzed
Some of the core metrics explored in this project include:

- Daily and Monthly Active Users (DAU / MAU)
- Conversion rates across funnel stages
- User retention and cohort analysis
- Revenue trends
- ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)

---

## 📈 Deliverables
By the end of the project, the following outputs are produced:

- A well-structured SQL-based data model
- Clean and reusable SQL queries for business metrics
- A product analytics dashboard
- Clear business insights and recommendations

---

## 🔍 Key Insights (Work in Progress)
> This section will be updated as the analysis progresses.

- Funnel drop-offs by stage
- Retention behavior across user cohorts
- Revenue concentration by user segment

## Dataset Summary
The dataset contains e-commerce user events collected between October 2019 and April 2020.  
For performance and clarity, this project focuses on a single month of data (October 2019).

Initial exploration confirms a clear conversion funnel and sufficient volume for robust analysis.

## 🚀 Next Steps
Possible extensions to this project include:

- A/B test analysis
- Predictive churn modeling
- Deeper segmentation by user behavior
- Experiment tracking framework
