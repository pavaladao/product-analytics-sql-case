# Product Analytics Case Study — SQL & Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world **Product Analytics** scenario where a data analyst is responsible for analyzing user behavior, conversion funnels, retention, and revenue metrics for a digital product (SaaS / app).

The goal is to demonstrate strong **SQL skills**, solid **data modeling**, and the ability to translate data into **business insights** that support product and growth decisions.

---

## 🎯 Business Questions
The analysis focuses on answering key questions such as:

- Where are users dropping off in the product funnel?
- How does user retention behave over time?
- Which user cohorts generate the most value?
- What metrics should product managers monitor daily?
- Where are the biggest opportunities to improve conversion or revenue?
